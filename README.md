# TechHelpStack
Tech Help Stack (THS) is a web application that provides a platform where questions can be asked and answered by users. This is similar to what we see on StackOverflow.  After we have finished the code for the API endpoints and tested it, we must now provide a user interface which can help users take advantage of the backend code.
